## Environment Variables

## Requirements
Prior to running this locally, you'll need a Chatkit instance. 

To create one, navigate to the [Pusher Dashboard](https://dash.pusher.com/), login and hit **create new**, enter a name for the instance. Make sure to note down your **Instance Locator** and **Secret Key**, located under the `keys` tab, as we'll need this later!
